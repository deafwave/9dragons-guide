Some of these only have the majority of 2nd chapter - but these are usually the most problematic ones.
After that chapter, the RTDs largely follow the same structure - CC quests are all the same.

**If you still get confused with RTD, ask in [#questions](https://discord.com/channels/1011378367590834287/1209473023896461402) so we can all benefit from the knowledge!**
