# PVE Points Guide
Due to the way that PvE points are calculated, the mob must be above or equal to your level.

As such the strategy ends up being to run everything underleveled.

## PVE Basic Points
AutoBot mobs that you 1 hit that are white/yellow/red
Turn Off AutoBot Auto Chi-Breathing (unchecked)

## PVE Gold Points
Manually run Dungeons when you are below these thresholds

- CoF - 55
- VoH - 70
- Sup CoF - 142
- Sup VOH - ?
- Purple GCM - 131
- Sup GCM - ?
